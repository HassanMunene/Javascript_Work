✅ Likely Questions
1. Personal & Motivation

Tell us about yourself.

Why do you want to intern at Shamba Records? (you can link this to your father being a farmer in Meru 👌)


2. Understanding Shamba Records

From what you’ve seen, what problem is Shamba Records solving?

How do you think the farmer wallet improves farmers’ lives?

Why do you think Shamba Records chose Hedera instead of other blockchains? (They want to see if you understand efficiency, cost, and traceability — even if you’re not a blockchain pro).

How would you explain Shamba’s solution to a small-scale farmer with no tech background?

3. Technical Questions

Can you walk us through a project you’ve built that involved APIs, databases, or payments? (👉 you can talk about your Cybill Software reseller platform)

What’s your experience with databases? Which would you choose for farmer records and why?

How would you design a simple system to track farmer transactions reliably?

How would you ensure data security and privacy when dealing with sensitive data?

👉 Quick coding challenge (JS-based, 5–10 mins):

Reverse a string

Find duplicates in an array

Check if a string is a palindrome

Simple schema design for farmers + transactions

4. Problem-Solving / Product Thinking

If you were tasked with helping farmers access the products more easily, what would you build? (👉 you can mention USSD integration)

What challenges do you see in building offline-first solutions for rural farmers?

How would you design a tool for farmers to access market linkages?

5. Future & Learning

Do you have experience with blockchain or integrating external APIs?

What would you like to learn during this internship?

Where do you see yourself growing as a developer in the next few years?

⚡️So in short: expect

5–6 motivation/company-fit questions

3–4 technical/project/database/system design Qs

1 quick coding exercise

1 or 2 product-thinking questions (like USSD, offline-first, market linkages)

Do you want me to help you draft a structured self-introduction (1–2 mins) you can open with? It’s usually the first question and sets the tone.
