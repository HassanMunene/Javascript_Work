## How do you think Shamba Records’ farmer wallet improves farmers’ lives?
The farmer wallet directly improves farmers’ lives by solving the problem of delayed payments. Normally, farmers might have to wait up to 90 days to get paid after delivering produce, which limits their ability to reinvest in their farms, pay school fees, or handle emergencies. With the Shamba Records wallet, payments are made instantly in just a minute. This means farmers have quick access to their earnings, better cash flow, and more financial security. On top of that, because the wallet is blockchain-based and stablecoin-backed, farmers don’t lose money due to currency fluctuations and their transactions are secure and transparent. It also opens doors to other financial services like credit and insurance. Essentially, the wallet turns farming into a more reliable and sustainable livelihood.
