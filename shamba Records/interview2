## How do you think Shamba Records’ farmer wallet improves farmers’ lives?
The farmer wallet directly improves farmers’ lives by solving the problem of delayed payments. Normally, farmers might have to wait up to 90 days to get paid after delivering produce, which limits their ability to reinvest in their farms, pay school fees, or handle emergencies. With the Shamba Records wallet, payments are made instantly in just a minute. This means farmers have quick access to their earnings, better cash flow, and more financial security. On top of that, because the wallet is blockchain-based and stablecoin-backed, farmers don’t lose money due to currency fluctuations and their transactions are secure and transparent. It also opens doors to other financial services like credit and insurance. Essentially, the wallet turns farming into a more reliable and sustainable livelihood.

## What is Ethereum? vs Hedera
Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchains, but it can be slow and expensive to use because of high transaction fees. Hedera, on the other hand, is designed to be faster, cheaper, and more scalable. For farmers, that really matters — they can’t afford high fees eating into their payments. So I think Shamba Records chose Hedera because it makes instant payments and traceability affordable and practical for smallholder farmers.

on Block chains like Ethereum every time you make a transaction eg sending money or recording data you pay a fee. That fee is called Gas fee. It is basically the cost of using the blockshain. The problem is that these gas fees are usually expensive on Ethereum. For a farmer who just want to receive a 10 dollar payment, paying a 3 dollar gas fee doesnt really make sense and thats why shamba records decided to go with Hedera which has low gas fees and predictable transactions.
