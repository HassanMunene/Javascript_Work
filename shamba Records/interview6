## Tell us about yourself.
My name is Hassan Munene, I am a Full stack software developer who can comfortably work both on the frontend and backend of applications. So of the project I have been proud to work on include Cybill Software platform which involdved intergrating payment gateways, APIs and dashboard for different stakeholders of the system.
What really keeps me motivated continue developing solutions is an opportunity to work at a company like Shamba records that is trying to solve the problem that is at the cornestone of our society and that is helping farmers get better returns, reduce riska and produce more. On top of that help farmers who previously did not have any opportunity of accessing loans get that opportunity. 
On a personal Note I have been born and raised in Meru. My parent are small scale farmers of Macadamia , I have been educated by that and so I understand the problem a small scale farmer in Kenya faces and therefore this mission is specifically personal to me. 

## Why do you want to intern at Shamba Records?
I want to intern at Shamba Records because I truly believe in the mission of the company. Africa has the fastest growing population, and agriculture is at the heart of how we feed that growth and sustain our economies. However, smallholder farmers often face challenges such as limited access to finance, lack of accurate records, and difficulty getting fair returns for their produce.

What excites me about Shamba Records is how you’re using technology—digital records, data, and financial innovation—to address those exact challenges. As a software developer, I want to apply my skills to something meaningful, and helping farmers gain access to credit, reduce risks, and improve productivity is a mission I deeply connect with.

## What excites you about using technology to solve agricultural challenges?
What excites me most is the chance to use technology to solve problems that directly affect people’s lives. Agriculture is not just another sector—it’s the backbone of food security and livelihoods for millions of families, especially in Africa. Small innovations in technology can make huge differences: for example, digital records can help farmers prove their credibility, mobile payments can give them faster access to credit, and data analytics can help them plan for weather or market shifts.

As a software developer, I’m excited about how something I build on a screen can translate into real impact in the field—helping a farmer get a fair price, reduce risks, or secure a loan they couldn’t access before. That combination of technology and tangible human impact is what motivates me to work in this space.

## If you were tasked with helping farmers access the products more easily, what would you build?
I would focus on building a simple and accessible channel that meets the farmers where they are. Majority of the farmers probably dont have smartphones and also in rural areas the internet coverage is that much yet. So what I would is deign a USSD service we can use any of the ussd providers we have then connect it to our backend for both web and mobile just to ensure that the data stays syncrinized. 
SO maybe if a farmer wants to check their wallet balance they can just dial a code and they get the response instantly.
