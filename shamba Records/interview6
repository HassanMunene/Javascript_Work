## Tell us about yourself.
My name is Hassan Munene, I am a Full stack software developer who can comfortably work both on the frontend and backend of applications. So of the project I have been proud to work on include Cybill Software platform which involdved intergrating payment gateways, APIs and dashboard for different stakeholders of the system.
What really keeps me motivated continue developing solutions is an opportunity to work at a company like Shamba records that is trying to solve the problem that is at the cornestone of our society and that is helping farmers get better returns, reduce riska and produce more. On top of that help farmers who previously did not have any opportunity of accessing loans get that opportunity. 
On a personal Note I have been born and raised in Meru. My parent are small scale farmers of Macadamia , I have been educated by that and so I understand the problem a small scale farmer in Kenya faces and therefore this mission is specifically personal to me. 

## Why do you want to intern at Shamba Records?
I want to intern at Shamba Records because I truly believe in the mission of the company. Africa has the fastest growing population, and agriculture is at the heart of how we feed that growth and sustain our economies. However, smallholder farmers often face challenges such as limited access to finance, lack of accurate records, and difficulty getting fair returns for their produce.

What excites me about Shamba Records is how you’re using technology—digital records, data, and financial innovation—to address those exact challenges. As a software developer, I want to apply my skills to something meaningful, and helping farmers gain access to credit, reduce risks, and improve productivity is a mission I deeply connect with.
