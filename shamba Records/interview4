## How to explain USSD integration (high-level, interview style)
Most farmers dont have smartphone or internet majority have basic phones, with ussd a farmer can dial something like *123# to get a simple text menu to check their wallet balance. withdraw money or even see the available products.

On the backend the USSD provider like safaricom connects to our backend or our servers through APIs. When a farmer dials a code the request goes to safaricom, safaricom forwards the request to our backend our backend looks up and returns the response. 

So if the farmer sends something like check balance, our API queries the wallets table. in the database, 

I haven’t personally implemented USSD before, but I understand the flow: telcos like Safaricom provide APIs that link the farmer’s USSD input to our backend. Since I’ve already worked with APIs and databases in past projects, I’d be confident I can pick up USSD integration quickly with guidance from the team.

## What’s your experience with databases? Which would you choose for farmer records and why?
For the cybill software project, I built tables for patrner, tables to store trascations and license of kaspersky. and transactions so that the system could track commissions and sales reliably. 

For farmers records I would use a relational database like Mysql or Postgres. The reason is farmer data involves structured records. eg farmer details, wallets, transactions and market orders. which all need very clear relationships.
