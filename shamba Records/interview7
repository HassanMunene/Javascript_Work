## What is blockchain
This is a system of storing information that makes it extremely difficult to hack, cheat or even change the information. Generally we can trust this system because we know everything on it is true and accurate. Everyone in the network has a copy of that transaction. 

Imagine everytime a farmer delivers a produce like maize to a cooperative an entry is made in this logbook. But instead of the cooperative holding the only copy, every single actor invovled from the farmer, buyer the exported gets an identical copy of the transaction

The reason why I believe that this technology is revolutionaly especially to farmers is because it addresses oned of the biggest challenges that farmers have 
1. Lack of transparency they often dont have a clear record of where there produce went and how the price was determined.

2. proof of compiance. withouth this kind of technology it is hard for them to prove that their crops are organic,or have susteinable farming which 
3. Lack of access to finance. 

Blockchain solves this by crating an immutable journey for every sack produced.

## Containerization
This is the practise of packaging an application togethere with all it dependencies and its configurations into a container. This will ensure that the application will run consistently across diffeent environment. The advantege of containers is very clear especially when its comes to scaling. if the traffic spikes we can just spin up another instance of our application 

it is like a portable mini computer that will always run the same, whether you are on laptop, render, aws, digital ocean.
