Solving one of the most pressing needs and challenges . Track accessiblity tool to track data from the farm. 
Auto mate a number of key essential services to the farmers , prvoding a farmer wallet, which is able to cut down the payment period from 90 days to just a single minute. 
unloack new credit lines for the farmers.

Also provide market linkages to the farmers to make sure whatever they produce they are able to to get it to a ready market. 

Increase 30% of their income, yields.

Africa is the highest growing continent in terms of population. by 2050 the population of Africa will be about 2.5 billion people. that means the food production capacity will not be the same anymore it has to go up. only a small percentage of total commercial credit goes to the farmers. 

Also helping farmers to be compliant to standards they are required to export product 

Hedera Network.
A partener to help the company scale and has low latency levels. Very high transactional. 
talking about being able to run credit scores for farmers, make transactions to farmers. being able to link the farmers to the buyers. 

How shamba records is using Hedera:
1. onChange tracebaility, Hedera filing system each and every collection is backed up by a blockchain Id. You can trace from the source to the market.
2. providing the farmer Wallet, the farmers can get instant payment, and cut the period of their payment from 90 days to just 1 minute. 
3. Exposing the farmers to the carbon credit markets. so Hedera is helping verify the origin of those carbon credits.

Shamba records uses stable coins to avoid all the fluctuations to make sure the farmer is able to receive what they are supposed to receive. 

Shamba records main goal is to solve the farmers needs first of all. 

Final goal is to be able to provide a hyper local solution. They can be able to access a solution even offline. They dont need to have a smartphone. They dont need to understand that blockchain is running the engine. At the end of the day we dont need something sooo beatiful if it cant help the most common farmer. is the famrer able to increase his or her income. 

RIght now running the compaing the farmer coupons. 

 technology like AI and blockchain for services such as microloans, crop insurance, and market access for farmers. 

# Some of the questions I might get:

## General / Motivational

1. Why do you want to intern at Shamba Records?
- I want to intern at Shamba Records because I really believe in the mission. I‚Äôve seen firsthand the challenges farmers face ‚Äî my parent are is a farmer in Meru, and I‚Äôve grown up understanding how hard it can be to access markets, get paid on time, or even secure credit. When I listened to how Shamba Records is solving these exact challenges with technology, it really resonated with me. For me, this isn‚Äôt just about software engineering ‚Äî it‚Äôs about building solutions that can make a real impact in people‚Äôs lives, starting with farmers like my dad. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm excited to contribute my skills here: to be part of a team that is using blockchain, AI, and fintech not just as buzzwords, but as tools to transform livelihoods.

2. From what you know, what problem is Shamba Records solving?
From what I understand, Shamba Records is solving one of the biggest challenges farmers face ‚Äî 
- lack of access to timely payments, 
- credit - using digitized farm records to build a digital credit profile and credit score
           which then unlocks loans for various farming needs This data-driven approach bypasses the need for traditional collateral, like land titles, and instead assesses a farmer's creditworthiness based on their farm performance, productivity, and transaction history.
        
- reliable markets.
Many farmers have to wait up to 90 days to get paid, which creates a huge financial burden. Shamba Records solves this by providing a farmer wallet that enables instant payments. They‚Äôre also tackling the issue of traceability by using Hedera‚Äôs blockchain, so buyers can trust the origin of produce and farmers can meet compliance standards. On top of that, Shamba Records helps farmers unlock new credit lines, access carbon credit markets, and connect directly to buyers, which ultimately increases their income and makes farming more sustainable. At the heart of it, the company is making sure technology directly improves the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.

3 How do you think technology can transform agriculture in Africa?
- I believe technology can completely transform agriculture in Africa by making it more efficient, transparent and profitable for farmers. For example, digital wallets and mobile money can ensure farmers get paid instantly rather than waiting months. Blockchain can provide traceability, helping farmers meet export standards and tap into global markets. AI can help predict weather patterns, detect crop diseases early, and guide farmers on the best farming practices. Even simple offline-first tools using USSD or SMS can give smallholder farmers access to market prices, credit, and insurance without needing a smartphone. In short, technology can bridge the gap between farmers and opportunities ‚Äî turning agriculture into a more sustainable and attractive livelihood while ensuring food security for a fast-growing population.

Why are you interested in combining software engineering with agriculture/impact-driven solutions?


## What excites you the most about blockchain/AI/fintech in agriculture?

Blockchain offers a tamper proof, transparent way to track a crops journey from seedling to store on a shelf
it is a new trust layer in food system long plagued by opacity. and for farmers it more than a technology but a voice.

for Example there are new regulations from EU taking effect from 2025 demands that proof that products like
coffee are grown without deforestation. and Mind you EU import close to 7.5 billion euros worth of agriculture
from Africa annually. Thats all dependes on tracebility at the moment.
