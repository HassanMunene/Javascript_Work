## ReFi - Regenarative Finance
This goes beyond just making profit. Like the way traditional finance does of even DeFi that is Decentralised Finance ReFi focuses on using financial systems to support social equality, 

Example of ReFi in action is maybe Carbon Credits on BlockChain. We tokeninze credits for farmers so that farmers can trade them transparently that helps tackle the problem of climate change and also reward sustainable practices. 

Another example is farmers who use eco friendly practices like reforestation can earn credit

ReFi basically alings finance and positive impact the more you regenerate like soil carbon the more you earn. 

## What are Carbon credits
Carbon credit is basically a permit that represent 1 tonne of C02 removed from the atmosphere. or not released
Something like planting trees, using renewable energy, or sustainable farming, can contribute to getting carbon credits.

Companies or indiviuals who pollutes the air buy carbon credits to offset the emssions

Let’s say a farmer in Kenya switches from harmful chemical fertilizers to regenerative farming that improves soil health and captures more carbon.

An auditor verifies how much CO₂ was saved or absorbed.

The farmer earns carbon credits (maybe 100 credits this year).

The farmer can then sell those credits on a carbon market to companies that need to offset their pollution.

That means extra income for the farmer just by farming sustainably.
